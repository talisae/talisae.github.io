I guess I was in a place where there was a great path laid out for me and although I worked to build that path out, I think I just started following it. I've worked for an amazing technology company for almost seven years. That's a long time, and on the road I was on, as I continued to advance, my options became more and more limited. Throughout this past summer I realized it was really time for something different and to define some new opportunities. It was time for me to find something that can help me develop some new skills and change my future! I still love what I do and how it impacts the the lives of the people around me but I'm not learning much and I knew it was really on me to start something for myself. So, here I am!

I meddled with other online courses, talked to some friends, did some reasearch on some websites, and Flatiron School is where I landed. I fell in love with learning something new and started appreciating being stuck, and working through new challenges. I've learned the composure and patience of dealing with ambiguous situations, at work. I'm here to combine those skills with another thing I enjoy, coding. I'm excited to build on what I've done so far and so excited to see how far I can take my new passions.
